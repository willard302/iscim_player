  introduce_article: "The human brain consists of 100 billion neurons connected by 100 trillion nerves. When large numbers of neurons send synchronized pulses, they oscillate and form wave-like brain waves. The shape of brain waves is closely related to the operation of our body's various systems, daily routines, and circadian rhythms. iSCIM Music Therapy produces special curative frequency music according to the daily climate rhythm to help you maintain the correct balance of brain waves so that you can present your best every day.",
